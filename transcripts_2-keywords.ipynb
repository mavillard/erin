Well I think something that I’ve seen that has really really diminished is the concept and use of storytelling, and actually passing on knowledge, because I have this hunch and I haven’t been able to find it, I haven’t been able to find any direct evidence of it in quite some time, but our stories were, our stories and our legends were clearly used as a teaching tool and they probably also had some really deep scientific knowledge about how processes in life work and how the world interacts with itself and how people should interact with the world by learning about how the processes of things happen within the environment.  I think that we’ve… I know that its, I haven’t seen much of that really, ever, and part of the problem is that people really aren’t out on the land anymore and people aren’t utilizing it as much as they used to.  There’s a major decline in hunting, and knowledge of how to survive without having to go to the grocery store and how to make actual money in order to keep your family eating.  So I think part of it is, on one hand there’s a major need to connect people with the environment again so they can start learning from it again, and I think that once that thing starts happening, what I hope to be a movement, again I think that a lot of those stories will come back.

We just really lost the ability to interpret and I think its because we’re not connected to the land anymore.

Probably my favorite place to go was out in the back and just sit out in a tree and write, and you know just sit there and listen and hear things and check stuff out.  Go swimming in the ditch, which I think about it now is really disgusting because it’s the same ditch that runs by the Snye subdivision, but when they first dug it I don’t think it was connected to the Snye subdivision at that point.  It ran through from the river down the end of the road, at the Snye, it got closed in probably when I was around five or six or maybe even seven because the road would washout every year.  We could only drive down our road maybe six months out of the year.  It was pretty rough, fairly rustic, and I think those experiences, along with… my Dad always hunted, we always, we typically ate quite a bit of wild game, tons of fish, and we knew the bush, we knew the whole area that we lived in because we spent a lot of time exploring it, we were always out in the marsh, we were always out on the water.

At one point somebody told me about a specific place on the dredge cut where the kids would swim and the adults would hang out.

Those aren’t our ducks to give away.  We don’t need them, the hunters that come in don’t need them, I guarantee you they don’t need them.  If they can spend $10,000 a year on a membership to a hunt club I guarantee you they don’t need ducks.  I mean those are our brothers and sisters we’re whoring out.

We have to get rid of the muskrats because they poke holes in the dyke, they dig holes and the dykes will fall in, and as a result we won’t be able to manage for ducks and that’s clearly the whole idea of managing for ducks is so unsustainable and right now we see the hunt clubs are in really rough shape because of it.

She noted that there is an overwhelming lack of respect for resources.  Just as she had in the previous interview, Aimee noted that somehow it has become ‘ok’ exploit and waste resources.

She doubted community members harvest sweetgrass in this manner, and commented further that the local sweetgrass harvesting industry likely supports people’s drug habits.  This raised the discussion to social problems on Walpole, and how care of the environment, things like respect for the ability of sweetgrass to replenish itself, becomes a lower priority.  She wondered if a possible solution to the lack of awareness and respect for these resources might be addressed through a mentor system in which community Elders who are knowledgeable in particular areas educate younger generations who might need the gentle guidance and authority of community Elders.'),\n",

One of the problems she noted was with education and how it results in what Rick described as ‘a fight to get to the bottom.’  Specifically, Aimee pointed to a culture on the Island where community members hold everybody else back.  This, she surmised, related to a disregard of the ‘white system’ and the desire of community members to excel in society.  Ultimately, she commented on how intellectual curiosity is frowned on in the community, and kids that do express interest in math, science, and other areas of learning are teased.  She recalled a story about a brother of hers who noted, on attending an elementary school off Reserve, ‘they don’t make fun of you for being interested in stuff.’'),\n",

A further problem that develops from this is mould problems related to the government housing standards used to build in Native communities, so environmental and human health is dually threatened.  But again, Aimee asked the question, ‘who can afford to build a house?’  Not many.  Aimee drew Rick’s attention to Walpole’s demographics, specifically the fact that 48 percent of the community’s population is under 26 years of age, and housing should reflect this demographic shift.  Rather than build houses for single occupancy families, perhaps housing with higher occupancy / apartments or adjoined condos that require less space are encouraged.
